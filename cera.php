            <h1>Ceramic technology </h1><br><br>
            Ceramic Technology is an emerging branch of Engineering/Technology dealing with the study of the properties, manufacture, design and applications of ceramic materials.<br> 
            The ceramic designers are concerned with designing various types of ceramic wares used in industries, households, institutions, corporate houses and other places. <br>
            The use of ceramic ware can be for both decorative as well as functional purposes.<br>
            Ceramic products include table and kitchenware, decorative ware like flower vase, insulators, potters, building materials like tiles, etc.<br>
            Cement is also considered as one of the ceramic materials.<br>
            A ceramic technologist is concerned with study, research and development of the ceramic materials, planning and developing processing systems, designing and construction of plants and machinery along with other engineers, planning and implementation of processing methodologies, designs and development of various applications like glass, porcelain, cement, refractors, insulators, composite materials, enamels, cement etc.<>
 

            <br><br>
<h1>What does an Ceramic technology  graduate do?</h1><br>
 
•	An individual who aspires to make a career in Ceramic Technology is sure to find himself loaded with a wide range of job opportunities.<br>
•   It could be as an entrepreneur or as an employee in a large-scale ceramic ware manufacturing unit, or even in a steel refractory or as a researcher in a lab.<br>
 

<br>

<h1>Some job titles</h1>
<br>
•Ceramic Engineers deals with the study of the properties, manufacture, design and applications of ceramic materials.<br>
 Ceramic engineers are involved in any of the following areas of work:<br>
 
 Research : Ceramic technologists use their scientific knowledge to anticipate new applications to replace existing products.<br> 
 Research work involves the study and application of chemical and thermal interactions of oxides which make ceramics.<br>
 
  
 Design : Ceramic engineers modify the design of the machinery and tools used in the production process and also work on the design of ceramic products.<br>
 
  
 Production: Since ceramic has such diverse uses the ceramic technologists generally specialise in the technological developments of specific production processes.<br>
 Ceramic technologists may specialise in glass working in industries engaged in manufacture of tableware, fibre optics, bulbs, window panes, electronics ancillaries. Specialist in structural clay work in the manufacture of enamelled articles and pipes, engine pars, tools artificial limbs or cement used in construction or ceramic wares such as tiles, pottery and bathroom and kitchen fixtures.
 Highly demanding specialisation is for the electronics sector for manufacturing integrated circuits, sensors etc.<br>
  
 Testing : The samples prepared for production are tested for color, surface finish, texture, strength and uniformity and for the and for the correction of the manufacturing processes by engineers in testing laboratories. Even the quality of raw materials used in the industry is tested.<br>
