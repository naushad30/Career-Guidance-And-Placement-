            <h1>Electrical & Electronics Engineering </h1><br><br>
            Information technology (IT) is the technology required for information processing.
            <br> In particular the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve information from anywhere, anytime
            <br><br>
<h1>What does an EEE engineer do?</h1><br>
 
•	Design/Develop Website or web based solutions<br>
•	Design/Develop Software used for various industries
<br>

<h1>What is the future for an EEE graduate?</h1>
 <br>
 Electrical & Electronics engineers can work in wide range of fields such as power generation, electronics, computers & control systems, telecommunication and Bio-Medical. EEE Engineers can find opportunities in any of the following categories
<br>

 <h1>Career Prospects</h1>
 
 Electrical engineering is a profession that uses science, technology, and problem-solving skills to design, construct, and maintain products, services, and information systems. Electrical engineering is the historical name for what is now called electrical, electronics, and computer engineering.
<br>
Typically electrical engineers have earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree in engineering in areas that include electronics, electrical engineering, or computer engineering. 
<br> A junior engi- neer may spend the first year or two on the job learning the company's products and design procedures before choosing a technical specialty.
<br>Job responsibilities include specification, design, development, and implementation of products or systems, as well as research to create new ideas. 
<br>This role provides a number of challenges ranging from problem identification and the selection of appropriate technical solutions, materials, test equipment, and procedures, to the manufacture and production of safe, economical, high-performance products and services.
<br>An electrical engineer may choose to couple the technical aspects of a position with management responsibilities.<br> The technical expertise required for management today is increasing because of the explosion of knowledge in engineering, technology, and science.
<br>A Bachelor of Science degree in engineering with a specialty in electrical engineering may also serve as a starting point for careers in many other diverse fields, ranging from business to law, medicine, and politics, since the problem-solving skills acquired in an electrical engineering program provide an extraordinarily valuable asset. The same skills will equip you to assume leadership roles in your community and in professional circles outside the workplace.
<br>In addition to the primary fields of electrical, electronics, and computer engineering, a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering serves as an appropriate base for several allied fields. These include, for example, biomedical engineering, com- puter science, and aerospace engineering.<br>
